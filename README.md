![Grid](/src/images/gui/logo.png?raw=true "Grid")

The Grid engine is a 2D game engine built on LÃ–VE. It's inspired by Source, and
subsequently, QuakeWorld. It's a small, but powerful engine that provides a
significant amount of subsystems to you that you would otherwise need to write
by hand for your projects or game jams.
